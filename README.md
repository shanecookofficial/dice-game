# Dice Game

## About
---
Dice game is all about trying to get the highest score you can.

The game starts out with the player rolling 5 dice. If the player rolls a 1, they add 100 points for each 1 they have rolled that turn. If the player rolls a 5, they add 50 points for each 5 they have rolled that turn.

If there is a turn in which the player does not roll a 1 or a 5, the game is over.
